A historical anecdote recorded in Aristotle’s Constitutionof the Athenians (Aristot. Ath.

Ath. Pol. .; and Aristot. Ath. Pol. ., referring to the subsequent regime of  and ).

The role of social media in protest movements is a ﬁercely contested issue. Scholars note thecapacity of social media for the quick aggregation of publics around contentious issues andtheir potential for ﬂash mobilizations, a type of collective action that requires ‘only ephemeralengagements from participants’ (Earl, Hunt, Garrett, & Dal, 2014, p. 1). This has raised questions

around the empowering role of social media since it seems to facilitate mobilizations based onshallow commitments that fail to build long-standing relationships (Gladwell, 2010). As Dean

(2012) notes, ‘[c]ommunication technologies contribute to the displacement and dispersion ofcritical energy such that even as inequality has intensiﬁed, forming and organizing a coherentopposition has remained a persistent problem’ (p. 126).

Regardless of these efforts, the design of social media platforms meant that the administratorsof social media accounts had a signiﬁcant role in shaping the collective voice. Thus, some occu-

of social media accounts had a signiﬁcant role in shaping the collective voice. Thus, some occu-pations developed speciﬁc guidelines and management systems for the social media accounts ofthe movement. This was the case for one of the main Twitter accounts of Occupy Wall Street,@OccupyWallStNYC. The team administering the account was called ‘Tweetboat’, laterrenamed to ‘Tweetship’. Requests to join the team had to be discussed by Tweetboat membersand agreed by consensus. New members were added on Tweetboat with a ‘Limited’ permissionand with one of the administrators acting as a mentor who was responsible for training the newmemberandapprovingher/histweetsbeforetheywerepublished(Tweetingfor@OccupyWallStNYC).

Tweetboat activists also had guidelines about the tone of the collective voice: ‘Organizationaltwitter handle is for organization (movement). Not personal causes/shout-outs. Keep it relevant toour tweebs (followers). Avoid “I” statements (**except** when being arrested, when you can

Of course, this did not prevent some cases where the collective voice seemed to be at war withitself. For example, the @OccupyLSX Twitter account became divided in August 2012 over themovement’s coverage of the Julian Assange case. On 20 August 2012, the following tweetappeared: ‘Some of us think #Assange is probably a rapist #FreeBradleyManning’. This attracted

to tweet their personal opinions. To that @OccupyLSX replied: ‘We start our messages with“some of us”, we never purport to speak on behalf of Occupy London’, thus challenging thenotion that the organizational account was representing the movement as a whole.

There were also conﬂicts over the number of people creating content for speciﬁc accounts, aswell as the processes of managing them. This was the case in London, when activists who weredisgruntled with the management of the ofﬁcial Facebook page, Occupy LSX, created a differentpage, Occupy London, which was administered with a more horizontal structure (Nafeesa, per-

sonal interview, June 10, 2013). Struggles over passwords and administration rights were alsovery frequent. There were calls for such rights to be distributed more equally, as well as instances

ism. More recently, antinuclear and prosolar energy movements in Europe and America have adopted a similar notion as a centerpiece in their arguments. Thus environmentalist Denis Hayes concludes, "The increased deployment of nuclear power facilities must lead society toward authoritarianism. Indeed, safe reliance upon nuclear power as the principal source of energy may be possible only in a totalitarian state." Echoing the views of many proponents of appropri ate technology and the soft energy path, Hayes contends that "dispersed solar sources are more compatible than centralized technologies with social equity, freedom and cultural pluralism."3

It is no surprise to learn that technical systems of various kinds are deeply interwoven in the conditions of modern politics. The physical arrangements of industrial production, warfare, communications, and the like have fundamen tally changed the exercise of power and the experience of citizenship. But to go

It turns out, however, that the two hundred or so low-hanging overpasses on Long Island were deliberately designed to achieve a particular social effect. Robert Moses, the master builder of roads, parks, bridges, and other public works from the 1920s to the 1970s in New York, had these overpasses built to specifications that would discourage the presence of buses on his parkways. According to evidence provided by Robert A. Caro in his biography of Moses, the reasons reflect Moses's social-class bias and racial prejudice. Automobile

Anyone who has traveled the highways of America and has become used to the normal height of overpasses may well find something a little odd about some of the bridges over the parkways on Long Island, New York. Many of the overpasses are extraordinarily low, having as little as nine feet of clearance at the curb. Even those who happened to notice this structural peculiarity would not be inclined to attach any special meaning to it. In our accustomed way of look ing at things like roads and bridges we see the details of form as innocuous, and seldom give them a second thought.

would be free to use the parkways for recreation and commuting. Poor people and blacks, who normally used public transit, were kept off the roads because the twelve-foot tall buses could not get through the overpasses. One con sequence was to limit access of racial minorities and low-income groups to Jones Beach, Moses's widely acclaimed public park. Moses made doubly sure of this result by vetoing a proposed extension of the Long Island Railroad to Jones

responsabilidade. Uma organização que privilegia mecanismos de controlo e um poder vertical, esvazia o conceito de participação e de responsabilização dos professores. A democraticidade é, também, incompatível com o trabalho de legisladores, efectuado no desconhecimento da prática, ou por pessoas que dela recebem uma contribuição indirecta.

Esta democraticidade pode ser ponderada a partir do modelo dicotómico “sociedade igualitária-sociedade hierárquica”228. Na sociedade igualitária, a dependência de cada membro não se altera com a alteração da composição do grupo social. Na hierárquica, cuja composição pode ser representada num gráfico de árvore, a hierarquia degressiva das situações sociais institui uma dependência tão significativa quanto mais próxima a posição do indivíduo estiver de raiz. A deserção de um elemento do conjunto produz um corte intransponível na comunicação para uma multiplicidade de outros elementos situados a jusante relativamente ao topo hierárquico.

Estes dois tipos não são os únicos possíveis, mas o que importa reter é que “todas as nossas utopias actuais têm por fim a sociedade igualitária e todas as nossas organizações técnicas estão baseadas na sociedade hierárquica (...) não existem no estado puro, mas não faltam organizações que se aproximem de qualquer destes modelos”229.

Some social movement thinkers use variations on this same idea, with concepts such as radical democracy (Day 2005), direct democracy (Chatterton and Pickerill 2010), participatory democracy (Polletta 2002), and other forms of popular or people’s power (Esteva 2008).

Argentina. It is also in this way that the forms of decision making and governance take place. There is no rigid structure except that all participate, and over time participate increasingly; through participation we find new modes of participation. It is an open

participation we find new modes of participation. It is an open process that allows for more participation and agency, yet more and different participation, then changed people which, again, leads to new forms of participation.

Emilio, a participant in the movements in Argentina, described this process of decision making, and horizontalidad in particu-lar, as something that is both a ‘tool and a goal’, reflecting that full participation of equals cannot happen yet since society is not equal; he says that these processes are used to try to create a situ-ation where people can become more free and the process more meaningful. In this way horizontalidad is a tool for liberatory relationships. Emilio ended our conversation by saying that full achievement of horizontalidad would mean true freedom, with decision making and participation being central concepts to the creation of that freedom.

Horizontal spaces do not just occur spontaneously. People come together, sometimes spontaneously, but to create a space where all people can speak and be heard with the same equality and intention requires organization and structure. How much struc-ture and organization varies depending on the group, how long they have known one another, their relationships to each other, and so forth. For example, in the workplaces and unemployed neighborhoods there were often past relationships between people, which in many ways allowed for a more loose form of structure for the assemblies. In the neighborhood assemblies, most people spoke of meeting one another for the first time, and thus one would think that there might be a more struc-tured assembly; but what actually happened was that, especially at the start, they did not have much structure beyond a facili-tator and timekeeper. It was the unemployed neighborhoods and workplaces that created more roles in an assembly. This was in part due to the necessity of structured subgroups working on everything from production in the workplace, to bread baking, farming, house construction, direct action organizing

and so forth. I found the unemployed assemblies to be more organized based on concrete areas of work, and the neighbor-hood assemblies a lot more free-flowing. However, when there is less organization in a horizontal space, some people try to use that openness to dominate. While I am a huge advocate of struc-

of the research on digital public contention. Instead, we attempt to conceptualizepublicness as a process that is constituted through the material, temporal and spatialrelations from which it emerges. These relations are in turn affected by the use of

While these different conceptualizations of online publics have allowed research-ers to produce coherent narratives of contemporary public contestation, these con-cepts also obfuscate much of the complexity and constantly evolving nature oftoday’s protest. Focusing more on the public as an outcome of a process of public-ness, rather than on the process itself, the concepts of “counterpublics” and“network publics” are unable to capture the dynamic processes through which flowsof publicness emerge and circulate around the globe. In other words, they do not al-low us to think of publicness in motion, as flows of public contestation movingthrough time and from place to place.

Thus, we suggest shifting the focus from publics to publicness as a process ofmaking things public. In this sense, public denotes “what is visible or observable,what is performed in front of spectators, what is open for all or many to see or hearor hear about.” (Thompson, 1995, p. 123). This shift allows for a less static and rigidanalysis of public contestation that does not restrict it to something occurring in aspecific “place” and revolving around a particular “public,” which is more-or-lessstable through time. Instead, we aim to study publicness as a continuous activity ofmaking things public that allows topics to cross from the private to the public do-main, and which constitutes and reconstitutes the identity of key actors in publiccontestation. Paradoxically, with this move we effectively return to the original

movements. The power of administrators was especially contentious in Occupy, amovement that above all valued equality and horizontality. It was at the center ofvarious tussles and “password wars” with some administrators attempting to barothers from accessing the page. This harmed the legitimacy of the movement in the

Title: Non-Hierarchical Forms of Organization
==============================
In the case of bureaucratic hierarchical organizations, an attempt tomove out of this system may be perceived as going in the directionof the opposite, that is, a chaotic unstructured state. Alternatively, tran-sition from say a centralised to a decentralised system produces theconverse without necessarily changing the basic mode of operation ofthe organization.

There has been a view that a hierarchical organization is the onlypossible form of organization. This would be true, if each of the com-ponent parts are restricted to a specialised function. In this case a singlestructure of hierarchial levels is generated to coordinate the functioningof the spccialised parts.

Here again then, the process of social change can become lockedwithin and unable to go beyond the inherent organizational logic. Thesteps required to find a way out, are to(i) identify the basic assumptions which generate the organizationallogic,(ii) search for an alternative set of assumptions,(iii) derive the characteristics of alternative types of organizations.

The basic assumption which generates bureaucratic hierarchical struc-tures is that each member is restricted to a single specialised task. Asa result, a single structure of hierarchical linking relationships is esta-blished within which the functioning of each level is controlled by thenext higher level.If the one man-one task principle is abandoned, then the requirementfor a hierarchical organization disappears, and what results are organiza-tions which instead of having a single rigid structure of relationshipshave the capacity for multistructured functioning. (Fig. 2.)

The first case of an alternative type of organization which was stu-died in some detail is the composite autonomous group. This is basedon the principle that each member is able to carry out all, or at leastmost tasks. More recently it was discovered that if the principleis

The composite autonomous group. Within this type of group allmembers are capable of carrying out all or at least most tasks.The members of the group being equipotential, none has a specialleadership function. The special characteristics of this type of or-ganization is that it has no specific structure but can adopt anytemporary structure which is judged by the members to be appro-priate at any one time. Thus, there is no necessary requirement forall members to work together on any task or to make group deci-sions. They may at any one time each work individually or insubsets. However, the requirement in this case is that the activitiesof individual subsets of the group remain directively correlatedtowards the joint achivement of a specified aim. The requirementthat all members are able to carry out all tasks has as a consequencethat the required competence range for the total task will needto be within a feasible range. The size of the group is generallyrelatively small. However, there are examples of linked sets of auto-nomous groups which can operate as a unit of up to forty persons.

Title: Real not nominal global democracy A reply to Robert Keohane
==============================
4.  ConclusionDemocracy is not an all-or-nothing affair. It is always a matter of degree. The project of global democratization should be conceptualized not in terms of adoption of an overarching and predefined model (as Keohane’s “genuine democracy” would seem to be), but rather as multiple moves that can increase the degree of democracy in the system.30 Such moves might, for example, entail:•	the strengthening of accountability mechanisms, which can be seen as compo-nents of, rather than alternatives to, global democracy;31•	the proliferation of monitory mechanisms;•	contemplation of ways to promote the deliberative aspects of international negotiations;•	attention to the deliberative qualities of transnational governance networks, and the exclusions those networks often feature;•	expansion of the range of discourses that are represented in decision-making processes. So, for example, if transnational social movements succeed in get-ting international economic institutions to address questions of social justice in their decisions, that is a democratizing move—in which light it matters  little that activists or organizations are not themselves formally accountable  to anyone;•	Sortition initiatives that create a voice for ordinary citizens in governance. While the most relevant global experiment (World Wide Views) currently falls short of face-to-face deliberation of citizens from different countries, transnational citizen assemblies look a lot more feasible than elected bodies.

Title: Social media teams as digital vanguards the question of leadership in the management
==============================
Social media teams constitute an intriguing object of study, because they allow exploringthe important but largely invisible organisational structures that have emerged within recentsocial movements in their use of social media and lay bare the inconsistencies of dominantinterpretations of digital movements as ‘leaderless’, ‘non-hierarchical’ (Castells, 2012;Mason, 2012) or – to use a term that has become popular among activists – ‘horizontal’(Sitrin, 2006). In fact the very existence of groups tasked with the management of key com-

(Sitrin, 2006). In fact the very existence of groups tasked with the management of key com-munication channels suggests how far from having disappeared or become irrelevant, lea-dership, understood as a process of direction of collective action, involving various formsof inﬂuence and control (Melucci, 1996; Weber, 2002, pp. 221–225), continues to existalongside the participatory dynamics that have come to be considered as the signature ofprotest movements in a social media age.

To express the covert leadership performed bysocial media teams, these structures will be interpreted as ‘digital vanguards’, politicalgroups that perform a ‘vanguard-function’ (Nunes, 2014), of direction of collective action,in a way reminiscent of twentieth century political vanguards.

aspects of the working of social media activist teams: (a) their formation and composition;(b) processes of internal organisation; and (c) power struggles arising around the owner-ship and control of activist social media assets.

The argument of the article focuses on the contradiction between the techno-libertarianvalues predicated by these movements, and their nature as vanguards. Informed by theanti-authoritarianism of post-1968 movements and by the techno-utopianism of hackerculture, social media teams have adhered to principles of openness, horizontality, and lea-derlessness. Yet, rather than doing away with leadership the adoption of these principles

sibilities any open discussion of this issue is likely to hurt. Yet, the dominant consensusabout the ‘leaderless’ character of contemporary movements needs to be urgently con-fronted, not only because – as I will demonstrate in this article – abundant quantitativeand qualitative empirical evidence disproves it, but also because the techno-libertarian nar-rative of leaderlessness and horizontality is ethically and politically dangerous, since it allowsfor de facto leaders to remain unaccountable (Gerbaudo, 2012, pp. 165–166).

Horizontality expresses the rejection of hierarchy and a demand of radical equality.The term was popularised by Sitrin (2006) in her account of the 2001 Argentina occu-pation movement and its assemblies, but it has also become a referent to describe the par-ticipatory and networked nature of social media (see, e.g., Penney & Dadas, 2013).

The idea that the Internet constitutes a radically egalitarian democratic arena allowingfor egalitarian participation, which in recent years has been proposed by a number of the-orists (Shirky, 2008; Van Dijk, 2012), most famously by Castells (2000, 2004) in his theoryof the ‘network society’, also rests on questionable empirical grounds. Analysing the math-ematical properties of the Internet physicist Albert-Laszlo Barabási famously argued that itapproximated the model of a ‘scale-free network’ (Barabási & Albert, 1999; Barabási &Bonabeau, 2003). Scale-free networks follow power laws also known as Pareto distri-butions, that is, conditions in which highly connected nodes acting as ‘hubs’ tend to attractmore new links than less connected nodes. This centralising tendency is also seen in thefact that despite its widely celebrated distributed and de-centralised architecture the Inter-net has experiencedstrong forms of power concentration most glaringly manifested in therise of digital titans as Google and Facebook (McChesney, 2013).

The persistence of strong power differentials both within social movements and onlinecommunication has a strong bearing on what happens at the intersection between thesetwo ﬁelds: in the use of social media in connection with protest campaigns. In their analy-sis of tweets of the 2011 Egyptian revolution Christopher Wilson and Alexandra Dunnnoticed that the great majority was produced by 200 ‘power accounts’ (2011, p. 1265), atiny fraction of those involved in social media activity. A similar situation was evidencedwhen looking at the Indignados’ communication on Twitter in a study conducted byresearchers of the University of Zaragoza in Spain (González-Bailón, Borge-Holthoefer,Rivero, & Moreno, 2011, p. 8), and in a longitudinal study of Occupy Wall StreetTwitter communication (Wang & Wang, 2012). Both studies retrieved strong powerlaws. In conclusion, what we are witnessing is not the end of leadership and powerdynamics in a digital age but rather a reorientation of leadership and its adaptation tothe complex and fragmented landscape of post-Fordist societies.

The modern theory of vanguards originates from What is to be done? (1905) where Vla-dimir Lenin saw the vanguard party as the pivot of a successful revolutionary strategy. Thevanguard party was conceived as a highly centralised and hierarchical organisation capableof instigating revolutionary mass mobilisation by means of propaganda and agitation.Antonio Gramsci similarly described the vanguard party as a sort of ‘modern prince’, acollective leadership structure, assuming the role that in the past was performed by indi-vidual leaders (Gramsci et al., 1971, pp. 129–130). Due to its association with Leninism,

In more recent decades, the rise of the New Left and of new social movements in the1970s and 1980s has been accompanied by the emergence of organisational structuressuch as collectives and afﬁnity groups (Epstein, 1991), which, despite their anti-authori-tarian ethos, can also be interpreted as movement vanguards of sorts, due to the way inwhich they have acquired the role of organising hubs ‘leading the way’ for the entire move-ment. In her essay on the ‘tyranny of structurelessness’, for example, Jo Freeman noticed

how the rejection of formal organisation in the feminist movement was accompanied bythe emergence of activist elites, small groups of activists, and friends that thanks to theirexpertise and social capital ended up playing an inﬂuential but largely invisible role in thedirection of collective action (1972). Similarly to the collectives described by Epstein

apps used to collectively operate social media accounts. Finally, while social mediateams adopted the idea of leaderlessness and to an anti-authoritarian critique of power,they were torn by bitter disputes over the control of accounts.

This inclusivity reﬂected a genuine attempt to implement the value of openness predi-cated by social media teams. However, there are always practical limits to openness andinclusivity, and social media teams were no exception, with cliquishness often tendingto arise. Steve Reid a member of the anti-austerity campaigning group UK Uncut, for

A similar contradiction between principle and practice impinged the internal coordinationof social media teams. These groups ostensibly adopted ‘horizontal’ forms of internalcoordination, based on an assertion of radical equality, and the rejection of the clear div-ision of labour and ﬁxed roles of bureaucratic organisations as parties and trade unions(Rothschild-Whitt, 1979). Liam a member of the UK Uncut core activist team asserts

(Rothschild-Whitt, 1979). Liam a member of the UK Uncut core activist team assertsthat the main aim of social media use was to ensure horizontal communication withinthe movement. Similarly, Fabio Gándara, one the founders of Democracia Real Ya,argues that within DRY horizontal principles were applied, and that ‘you could not talkabout one or another person being leaders of the whole movement’. Despite these asser-tions of horizontality, the actual practice of these groups ended up being characterisedinternally by evident forms of power stratiﬁcation, with different participants possessingdifferent degrees of inﬂuence over the editorial process.

Within the 2011 wave ofprotest there have in fact also been manifestations of individual forms of leadership, asexempliﬁed in the role played by ‘micro-celebrity activists’ (Tufekci, 2013), individualswith large followings on Twitter and Facebook, sometimes acquiring a central positionin political conversations. Yet, it can be argued that digital vanguards had a more impor-

Despite these strengths, in the long term social media teams have experienced seriousissues, resulting from a mismatch between high-minded techno-libertarian principles ‒absolute openness, leaderlessness, and horizontality ‒ and a reality marked by the persist-ence of power differentials, and of typical scourges of movement politics such as faction-alism and opportunism.

The issues experienced by social media teams raise the question of possible solutions.For some scholars as David Kreiss and Zeynep Tufekci, the problem lies in the very infor-mal character of these movements, and their advice is thus that these movements shouldadopt formalised organisational structures (2013), as those of parties and NGOs. This lineof criticism seems, however, to ignore the long history of social movements as informalorganisations (Diani, 2000), precisely because of their criticism of formalised organisations

Incomparison, the cultural foundation ‘‘liberal democracy’’ is the supremacy ofindividual rights; namely, power is higher than kindness. Hence, its value system isliberalism. In comparison, the cultural mechanism of Democratic Centralism is‘‘collective good’’. The value system is populism which has been a part of Marxismin China.

The concept of Democratic Centralism came from Lenin. How could it take rootin China and become a vibrant political system in just a century? It has not only theforegoing profound cultural foundation, but also an ideological basis for governing

In general, the larger an organization is, the more complex and less directly-democratic its structure is. Indeed, it almost necessarily becomes more bureaucratic and hierarchical, because in order to function smoothly some specialization of roles is required.

Theoretically the entire body of workers could make these decisions collectively—perhaps everyone could receive a packet of information about the firm’s operations, study it for a week or two, and then congregate in a general meeting—but certain constraints make this unrealistic. As stated above, the time constraints may be prohibitive. Also, the information that has to be digested may be so technical that most workers are unable or unwilling to absorb it, preferring to leave it to specialists who have been trained in the particular topic. Or they may simply be apathetic and too exhausted at the end of the day to devote hours to administrative matters.64

For many reasons, therefore, some of which are not necessarily related to the nature of capitalist social structures, it may be necessary to have specialized professionals advising a board of directors. In a large cooperative, direct democracy will be the

Perhaps the most pervasive conflict is the tension among workers generated by different time commitments to the store and especially by different styles of working. As noted earlier, workers'

especially by different styles of working. As noted earlier, workers' hours at the store vary considerably, from fifteen to thirty-eight hours a week, depending on financial needs, outside interests, and the needs of the business. The amount of time spent at work connects people to the store in different ways and with varying degrees of intensity. As a general rule, the more hours people work in the store, the greater understanding they have not only of the ebb and flow of business but also of the complex social relationships that constitute the collective.

Conversely the less people work, the less connected they feel to the store and the more likely they are to be perceived, at least by some, as exploiters-people using the store simply to facilitate the pursuit of private goals. The more widespread such a perception is, the less influence these workers have in the store. People who work
