I must express my deepest gratitude to my adviser, Professor Kevin Gallagher,
whose guidance was not a map but a compass, and to the Department of Computer
Science at NOVA for fostering such critical inquiry. This research, however,
owes its very soul to the members of ComuniDÃ¡ria and Frente Anti-Racista; they
opened their doors with a rare and brave candor, and this thesis is built upon
their lived experience. To my friends who endured endless conversations and to
my family whose unwavering belief was the foundation for everything, thank you.
This work is as much yours as it is mine.
