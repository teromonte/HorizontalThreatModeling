This research explores the development of a threat modeling protocol
specifically designed for non-hierarchical organizations. Grounded in analyses
of distributed governance frameworks and security methodologies, the study
presents an innovative approach that treats horizontality as a strategic asset.
Leveraging tools such as attack trees, STRIDE, PASTA, and COLBAC, the protocol
aims to integrate cybersecurity with democratic participation, addressing the
unique challenges of decentralized structures. This work fills a gap in the
literature by providing practical guidelines to identify, mitigate, and prevent
threats in contexts where distributed trust and collaboration are essential.
