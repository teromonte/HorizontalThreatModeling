\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}

This Chapter aims at exemplifying how to do common stuff with \LaTeX. We also show some stuff which is not that common! ;)

Please, use these examples as a starting point, but you should always consider using the \emph{Big Oracle} (aka, \href{http://www.google.com}{Google}, your best friend) to search for additional information or al-ternative ways for achieving similar results.
