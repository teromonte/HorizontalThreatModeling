	abstract     = {Cybersecurity suffers from an oversaturation of centralized, hierarchical systems and a lack of exploration in the area of horizontal security, or security techniques and technologies which utilize democratic participation for security decision-making. Because of this, many horizontally governed organizations such as activist groups, worker cooperatives, trade unions, not-for-profit associations, and others are not represented in current cybersecurity solutions, and are forced to adopt hierarchical solutions to cybersecurity problems. This causes power dynamic mismatches that lead to cybersecurity and organizational operations failures. In this work we introduce COLBAC, a collective based access control system aimed at addressing this lack. COLBAC uses democratically authorized capability tokens to express access control policies. It allows for a flexible and dynamic degree of horizontality to meet the needs of different horizontally governed organizations. After introducing COLBAC, we finish with a discussion on future work needed to realize more horizontal security techniques, tools, and technologies.},

We facilitated a series of community workshops in which we invited participants to define their own cybersecurity threats, implement changes to defend themselves, and reflect on the role cybersecurity plays in their lives. In doing so, we contest both hierarchical approaches to users in cybersecurity—which seek to ‘solve’ the problems of human behavior—and a tendency in HCI to equate action research with the development of novel technology solutions. Our findings draw highlight barriers to engaging with cybersecurity, the role of personal experiences (for instance of gender, race or sexuality) in shaping this engagement, and the benefits of communal approaches to cybersecurity.},

	abstract     = {Cyber security is attracting worldwide attention. With attacks being more and more common and often successful, no one is spared today. Threat modeling is proposed as a solution for secure application development and system security evaluations. Its aim is to be more proactive and make it more difficult for attackers to accomplish their malicious intents. However, threat modeling is a domain that lacks common ground. What is threat modeling, and what is the state-of-the-art work in this field? To answer these questions, this article presents a review of threat modeling based on systematic queries in four leading scientific databases. This is the first systematic literature review on threat modeling to the best of our knowledge. 176 articles were assessed, and 54 of them were selected for further analysis. We identified three separate clusters: (1) articles making a contribution to threat modeling, e.g., introducing a new method, (2) articles using an existing threat modeling approach, and (3) introductory articles presenting work related to the threat modeling process. The three clusters were analyzed in terms of a set of criteria, for instance: Is the threat modeling approach graphical or formal? Is it focused on a specific attack type and application? Is the contribution validated empirically or theoretically? We observe from the results that, most threat modeling work remains to be done manually, and there is limited assurance of their validations. The results can be used for researchers and practitioners who want to know the state-of-the-art threat modeling methods, and future research directions are discussed.}

	abstract     = {Microsoft’s STRIDE is a popular threat modeling technique commonly used to discover the security weaknesses of a software system. In turn, discovered weaknesses are a major driver for incepting security requirements. Despite its successful adoption, to date no empirical study has been carried out to quantify the cost and effectiveness of STRIDE. The contribution of this paper is the evaluation of STRIDE via a descriptive study that involved 57 students in their last master year in computer science. The study addresses three research questions. First, it assesses how many valid threats per hour are produced on average. Second, it evaluates the correctness of the analysis results by looking at the average number of false positives, i.e., the incorrect threats. Finally, it determines the completeness of the analysis results by looking at the average number of false negatives, i.e., the overlooked threats.},
